So I did this course Game Design and what's a course on Game Design without a game?
Well, here it is. Made about seven days (more likely eight) and I thought it became quite cool.

How to Play
Your mission is to find teddy and his teddybear friends.
The problem is that it's dark and it's really hard to find them if you can't see
where you're going but thankfully you have a candle with you and if you're lucky
you can stumble on more candles to keep you from going completely dark.

Controls
Move with Arrow Keys
Switch and light candles with Space
Next Level: N
Previous Level: P
Reset Level: R
Console: F1
