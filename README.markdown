My config files for stuff.

# Different setups

Layouts differ from my portable and different layouts for single and dual screen modes on the desktop. Scripts `dual-screen` and `single-screen` toggle symlinks to `~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs` and `~/.xinitrc`. For portable manually set respective symlinks.

Assume dotfiles is in `~`. Add `~/dotfiles/bin` to path.

# TODO

1. Remove/rework `.conky`
2. Cleanup `.workspace`
3. Fully migrate from zsh to fish-shell
