My config files for stuff.

Some are incomplete and not used, but others such as [.vimrc][] are more complete. I also have my [xmonad][] dual screen setup and some scripts for the desktop there.

[.vimrc]: http://github.com/treeman/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc ".vimrc I use"
[xmonad]: http://xmonad.org/ "xmonad a nice tiling window manager"

Countdown to interesting stuff!

Cmd line days until `echo $(expr '(' $(date -d 2012-05-15 +%s) - $(date +%s) + 86399 ')' / 86400)`
